BIP 10 support

Decode and display transaction, in a way that assists human verification
of what they are signing.  MITM mitigation.

Errors are thrown via js exception.  This may be considered ugly,
dumping a lot of information that may obscure one useful nugget.  At a
minimum, someone should confirm that txtool exit status is zero
normally, but non-zero when an exception is thrown.

Bugs: RPC errors cannot be passed directly to throw.
