txtool may be used to pass around and sign incomplete (not yet fully
signed) transactions.

In this example, someone has emailed the raw hex data for a bitcoin
transaction, UNSIGNED.TXT.  The user signs the transaction, and then
emails SIGNED.TXT to another party.

$ ./txtool init
$ ./txtool raw.read UNSIGNED.TXT
$ ./txtool raw.sign
$ ./txtool raw.write SIGNED.TXT

Additionally, if the transaction is complete -- raw.sign reports
"sigs:complete" -- then the transaction may be broadcast on the network.

$ ./txtool raw.send
